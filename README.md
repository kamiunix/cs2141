Project title: Online Banking Implementation.

Application scenario abstraction:

      Tentative system & tools:
         Our project will be implemented within MySQL, the open source SQL DBMS. To be used
         externally on bluenose or exported localy.

      domain problem:
         How to implement a database for an Online Banking framework.
         
      application scenario:
         Online Banking Database access & modification

      business model & constraints overview:
         Customer Relationships:
            constraints on foreign keys (default null) and primary keys (not null).
         Branch Relationships:
            constraints on Primary keys (not null) and foreign keys   
         

      Following is a list of possible relations (references yet undefined):
         -branch
         -accounts
            -debit
            -savings
               -interest
            -credit
               -interest

            -banker
            -admin
         
      objectives:

      The objective of this particular project will be the creation and maintenance of an
      online banking database. We will attempt to incorporate daily banking features into
      our banking model to simulate a realistic online banking database. We'll include 
      views for the users - customers, bankers and admins -, basic transaction handling, 
      triggers, stored procedures and security protocols. Our fundamental goal will be to 
      create dynamic database wherein we can demonstrate live modifications.
